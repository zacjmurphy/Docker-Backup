### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary>1Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>How do I check if I am using the latest version on ElegantFin?</i></summary>

- To make sure that you are using the latest version of ElegantFin, check the version number at the bottom in the Dashboard screen.
- It should be something like ElegantFin v25.03.XX
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>I see that a newer version is available, but I have not received it yet. Why?</i></summary>

- If Dashboard footer shows an old version, it means that your app is still using an old cache.
- Once that cache is updated, the new version will be loaded.
- To get the latest version, you will need to clear cache. There are multiple ways to do it.
- On web version, force a hard refresh of the page using CTRL + F5.
- On apps, try signing out and back in again. OR in case of Jellyfin Media Player on windows, you might need to delete the cache folder. That should definitely pull the latest version.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>Why do I notice visual bugs and inconsistencies on Jellyfin Media Player?</i></summary>

- Currently JMP uses Qt 5.x which uses an outdated web engine, so many new CSS features do not work. Once they release a new version based on Qt 6.x, most issues should automatically be resolved. Until then, I advise using the web app instead.

<details>
  <summary>4Ô∏è‚É£ - <i>All the icons on my LG TV seem to be broken. How to fix them?</i></summary>

- It seems that modern Material Icons which this theme uses are [not compatible on some WebOS TVs](https://github.com/lscambo13/ElegantFin/issues/39). There is a [huge similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/e27go3/chinese_symbols_instead_of_icons_on_lg_tv/) about this.
- This bug can be fixed by using the older icons, so I have implemented the following workaround to bring back older, supported icons.
- Simply add the following code at the end in Custom CSS box and save, then refresh your apps and webpages:

  ```
  :root {
    --iconPack: 'Material Icons';
  }
  ```
